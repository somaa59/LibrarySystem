USER STORIES

1.As a user, I want to have a library card so that I can borrow books from the library.

2.As a librarian, I want to add new books to the library's collection so that they can
be available for borrowing.

3.As a librarian, I want to remove books from the library's collection so that we can
keep the collection up-to-date.

public void SaveBorrowBooks()
{
    var sp = new StringBuilder();
    var spBook = new StringBuilder();
    foreach(var item in _borrowdBoks) 
    {
        var user = item.Key;
        var books = item.Value;
        for (int i = 0; i < books.Count; i++)
        {
            spBook.AppendLine($"{books[i].Title},{books[i].Auth},{books[i].Year},{books[i].Borrowed}");      
        }
        sp.AppendLine($"{user.Role},{user.Id},{user.UserName}:{spBook.ToString()}");
